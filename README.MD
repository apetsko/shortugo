# Shortugo

Shortugo is a high-performance URL shortening service written in Go. It provides an API for generating short links, managing user-specific URLs, and interacting with a persistent database.

## üöÄ Features

- URL shortening (plain text, JSON, batch)
- Retrieve all user URLs
- Delete user URLs
- Expand shortened URLs to original
- Health check endpoint for database connectivity

|----------|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| `POST`   | `/`                       | Shorten URL (plain text)                |
| `POST`   | `/api/shorten`            | Shorten URL (JSON)                      |

| `GET`    | `/api/user/urls`          | Retrieve user's URLs                    |
| `DELETE` | `/api/user/urls`          | Delete user's URLs                      |
| `GET`    | `/{id}`                   | Expand shortened URL                    |
| `GET`    | `/ping`                   | Check database connectivity             |

## ‚öôÔ∏è Middleware

- `RealIP` ‚Äî extracts the real client IP
- `Recoverer` ‚Äî handles panics and returns 500 errors
- `LogMiddleware` ‚Äî logs requests and responses
- `GzipMiddleware` ‚Äî compresses responses using gzip

> ‚ùå The `RequestID` middleware was removed as part of performance optimization.

---

## ‚ö° Optimizations

The following changes were made to improve performance:

- üî• Removed `RequestID` middleware
- ‚öôÔ∏è Replaced `json.Marshal` with `json.NewEncoder(&buf)` to reduce memory allocations
- ‚öô Replaced `fmt.Sprintf` with string concatenation using `+` to reduce CPU usage.
- üîß Modified `GzipMiddleware` to use a `sync.Pool` for `gzip.Reader`, improving performance and reducing GC pressure.

```go
var gzipReaderPool = sync.Pool{
	New: func() any {
		return new(gzip.Reader)
	},
}
```
